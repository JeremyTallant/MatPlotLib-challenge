## Background
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pioneering pharmaceutical company, has recently embarked on a crucial study focusing on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer. In their latest animal study, they explored the efficacy of various drug regimens, including their primary drug, Capomulin, on 249 mice with SCC tumors over a 45-day period. As a senior data analyst, my role involves analyzing this extensive data to compare the performance of Capomulin against other treatments and providing comprehensive insights through tables, figures, and a summary of the study results. This study is a significant step in Pymaceuticals' mission to advance cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes.
