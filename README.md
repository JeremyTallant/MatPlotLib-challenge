## Background
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pioneering pharmaceutical company, has recently embarked on a crucial study focusing on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer. In their latest animal study, they explored the efficacy of various drug regimens, including their primary drug, Capomulin, on 249 mice with SCC tumors over a 45-day period. As a senior data analyst, my role involves analyzing this extensive data to compare the performance of Capomulin against other treatments and providing comprehensive insights through tables, figures, and a summary of the study results. This study is a significant step in Pymaceuticals' mission to advance cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes.
## Objective
This project aims to meticulously analyze and visualize data from Pymaceuticals, Inc.'s recent squamous cell carcinoma treatment study, leveraging Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The key objectives, essential for providing insightful conclusions, are outlined as follows: 
### 1. **Prepare the Data**
* Execute package dependencies and data imports.
* Merge the `mouse_metadata` and `study_results` DataFrames.
* Identify and handle any duplicate mouse IDs.
* Use the cleaned DataFrame for subsequent analyses.

### 2. **Generate Summary Statistics**
* Develop a DataFrame detailing summary statistics for each drug regimen, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume.

### 3. **Create Bar and Pie Charts**
* Utilize Pandas and Matplotlib to generate two identical bar charts showing time points for each drug regimen.
* Create two identical pie charts displaying the gender distribution of mice using both Pandas and Matplotlib methods.

### 4. **Quartiles, Outliers, and Box Plot Analysis**
* Analyze the final tumor volume for key treatments: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
* Calculate quartiles, IQR, and identify potential outliers.
* Generate a box plot for each treatment group, highlighting any outliers.

### 5. **Line Plot and Scatter Plot Creation**
* Select a Capomulin-treated mouse and plot tumor volume versus time point.
* Produce a scatter plot illustrating tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen.

### 6. **Correlation and Regression Calculation**
* Determine the correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin-treated mice.
* Fit a linear regression model and overlay this on the scatter plot.

### 7. **Final Analysis**
* Compile and submit all findings, including charts, plots, and statistical analyses.

## Implementation
In the implementation section of this project, we delve into the practical aspects of our analysis, detailing the specific steps and methodologies employed to extract, process, and interpret data from the squamous cell carcinoma study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc.
### Prepare the Data
#### Data Import and Merging
```python
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'

# Dependencies and Setup
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as st

# Study data files
mouse_metadata_path = "data/Mouse_metadata.csv"
study_results_path = "data/Study_results.csv"

# Read the mouse data and the study results
mouse_metadata = pd.read_csv(mouse_metadata_path)
study_results = pd.read_csv(study_results_path)

# Combine the data into a single dataset
combined_df = pd.merge(study_results, mouse_metadata, how='left', on='Mouse ID')

# Display the data table for preview
combined_df.head()
```
Essential libraries are imported, and mouse metadata and study results are read and merged into one DataFrame for analysis. 
#### Unique Mice Count
```python
# Checking the number of mice.
combined_df['Mouse ID'].nunique()
```
The total number of unique mice are calculated in the combined dataset.
#### Identifying Duplicate Mice
```python
# Getting the duplicate mice by ID number that shows up for Mouse ID and Timepoint. 
mice_duplicate = combined_df[combined_df[['Mouse ID', 'Timepoint']].duplicated()]['Mouse ID'].unique()
mice_duplicate
```
Mice with duplicate entries based on both `Mouse ID` and `Timepoint` are identified in the combined dataset.
#### Extracting Duplicate Mouse Data
```python
# Get all the data for the duplicate mouse ID. 
mice_duplicate_df = combined_df[combined_df['Mouse ID'].isin(mice_duplicate)]
mice_duplicate_df
```
All data associated with the identified duplicate mouse IDs are put in a DataFrame.
#### Creating a Clean DataFrame
```python
# Create a clean DataFrame by dropping the duplicate mouse by its ID.
clean_df = combined_df[~combined_df['Mouse ID'].isin(mice_duplicate)]
clean_df.head()
```
A clean DataFrame is generated by removing all entries of the duplicate mouse.
#### Verifying Unique Mice in Clean Data
```python
# Checking the number of mice in the clean DataFrame.
clean_df['Mouse ID'].nunique()
```
Confirming the count of unique mice in the cleaned DataFrame post-duplication removal.
